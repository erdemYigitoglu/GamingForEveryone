## what is there in it?   

Gaming for everyone is in its infency yet. Thus not much. My dream is to create a platform in which everyone can enjoy and growh with me. 

## why Gaming for everyone

###* growing together: 

I like the idea of a project that extends and grows as I improve my programming skills. I am currently studying [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I thought that I can showcase some gaming projects I do with TOP and get beyond those projects.

### * inclusive gaming

I am a blind person from turkey. As you can imagine I didn't have much computer based gaming options espetially in my mother tongue. I want to change it.
