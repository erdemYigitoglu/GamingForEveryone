	<h1>Gaming For Everyone</h1>
<p>a platform about gaming developed by people with diverse backgrounds and skills.
</p>
<h2>what is there in it</h2>?
<p>Gaming for everyone is in its infency yet. Thus not much. My dream is to create a platform in which everyone can enjoy and growh with me.
</p>
<h2>why Gaming for everyone
</h2>

<h3><li>growing together</li></h3>

<p> I like the idea of a project that extends and grows as I improve my programming skills. I am currently studying The Odin Project. I thought that I can showcase some gaming projects I do with TOP and get beyond those projects.
</p>

<h3><li>inclusive gaming</li></h3>

<p>I am a blind person from turkey. As you can imagine I didn't have much computer based gaming options espetially in my mother tongue. I want to change it.</p>

<h2>are you interested?</h2>
<p>if the idea of a gaming platform that everyone can enjoy regardless of their abilities intrests you. I am glad. There is a lot of work to do. As I said the project is in it's infency. So any help is significant and meaningful for the project. You can send me a email on erdemyigitoglu@gmail.com and we can talk about what can we do together.</p>
